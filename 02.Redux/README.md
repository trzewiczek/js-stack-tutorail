# 02. Redux

### üéì Some theory

Quote above makes it clear: Redux is not related to React and is not a frontend
framework. It's a library to make state management in JavaScript apps easy to
work with and reason about. It works smoothly with React, but it works fine with
console apps, Angular, and whatever you find it suitable for. It might as well
be possible that [You Might Not Need Redux](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367). 

First, let's start with a few facts about key Redux elements that will let you 
better understand how things talk one to another within Redux realm.

**Store**
 * a single JavaScript object representing application state wrapped by some 
   minimal `redux` interface (namely four methods!)
 * a single source of truth about the application and its state
 * keeps both data state (i.e. list of todos) and app state (i.e. sort order of todos)
 * never mutated, always replaced with a new object via `reducer` (see below)
 * can dispatch events (a.k.a actions‚Äîsee below)
 * can register middleware (more on that in next chapter)

```javascript
// example of the state managed by redux store
{
  todos: [
    { id: 0, text: 'Install yarn', status: 'DONE' },
    { id: 1, text: 'Learn Redux', status: 'IN_PROGRESS' }
  ],
  lastUpdated: 1493826516796,
  sort: {
    key: 'status',
    order: 'DESC'
  }
}
```

**Action**
 * a JavaScript object representing event in the application
 * at minimum it has to have a `type: <string>` field (see examples below)
 * along with type it may contain any data a.k.a. payload (see examples below)
 * it's dispatched by the `store`

```javascript
// minimal action example
{
  type: 'DELETE_ALL_TODOS'
}

// slightly bigger example
{
  type: 'ADD_TODO',
  todoId: 5,
  todoText: 'Implement Trello in Redux'
}

// even bigger example
{
  type: 'ADD_TODO',
  todo: {
    id: 5,
    text: 'Implement Trello in Redux'
  },
  todoList: 'JS Stack Tutorail',
  meta: {
    status: 'SUCCESS',
    timestamp: 1493826516796
  }
}
```

**Reducer**
 * a [pure function](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-pure-function-d1c076bec976) 
   that transforms current store's state into next state using action payload
 * it's signature is: `(state = <default state>, action) => state`
 * [called every time store dispatches an action](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/blob/master/src/createStore.js#L170)
 * if default value for state argument is defined the value will initialize the 
   state when the `store` is created
 * by convention `reducer`'s body is a single `switch` statement
 * if triggered by an event (`action.type`) it doesn't understand, returns `state` untouched

```javascript
// reducer example
const reducer = (state = { todos: [], sort: { key: 'id', order: 'ASC' } }, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'SORT_KEY_CHANGED':
      return {
        ...state,
        sort: {
          key: action.sortKey,
          order: action.sortOrder
        }
      }
    case 'TODO_ADDED':
      return {
        ...state,
        todos: [
          ...state.todos,
          {
            id: action.todoId,
            text: action.todoText,
            status: 'NEW'
          }
        ]
      }
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

There are some other interesting concepts in Redux we will learn later into tutorial. 
These three though create the core of what Redux is: 

 * a single `store`, `{ todos: ['Learn Yarn'] }`
 * dispatches `actions`, `{ type: 'ADD_TODO', text: 'Learn Redux' }`
 * which trigger pure `reducers`, `(state = { todos: [] }, action) => state`
 * aimed at transforming store's state, `case 'ADD_TODO': return { todos: [...state.todos, action.text ] }`
 * to its new shape, `{ todos: ['Learn Yarn', 'Learn Redux'] }`
 
That's it. 

### üõ† Basic setup
To the code! We start with installing `redux`:

```bash
[js-stack-tutorail]$ yarn add redux
```

Congratulations! We're done with setup. üèÜ

### üöÄ In action
Before we do some real coding let's use the example from last bullet list 
above to test if `redux` really works this way. 

Create a `src` folder and put the unit test file inside:

```bash
[js-stack-tutorail]$ mkdir src
[js-stack-tutorail]$ touch src/index.test.js
```

From three elements mentioned above‚Äîstore, action and reducer‚Äîit is `reducer` that
actually does something (i.e. transforms old state into new state with action 
payload). We'll start with it then. Good news is, it's a pure function which 
makes it trivial to test. Let's collect the spec!

Earlier we've mentioned four assumptions about each and every `reducer`:

 1. it initializes the state with a default value if no state is defined yet
 2. it creates new state based on both old state and action payload
 3. it doesn't change the old state
 4. it doesn't affect the state at all if it doesn't recognize the `action.type`

One unit test for each gives us:

```javascript
// index.test.js
import { reducer } from './index'

describe('Todo List Reducer', () => {
  it('should initialize store with empty todo list', () => {
    const initialState = undefined
    const anyAction = { type: 'ANY_ACTION' }

    const expectedState = { todos: [] }

    const newState = reducer(initialState, anyAction)

    expect(newState).toEqual(expectedState)
  })

  it('should add todo to the end of todo list', () => {
    const initialState = {
      todos: [ 'Learn Yarn' ]
    }
    const action = {
      type: 'ADD_TODO',
      text: 'Learn Redux'
    }

    const expectedState = {
      todos: [ 'Learn Yarn', 'Learn Redux' ]
    }

    const newState = reducer(initialState, action)

    expect(newState).toEqual(expectedState)
  })

  it('should create a new state leaving an old one untouched', () => {
    const initialState = {
      todos: [ 'Learn Yarn' ]
    }
    const action = {
      type: 'ADD_TODO',
      text: 'Learn Redux'
    }

    const newState = reducer(initialState, action)

    expect(initialState).not.toEqual(newState)
  })

  it('should leave state untouched when action is not recognized', () => {
    const initialState = {
      todos: [ 'Learn Yarn' ]
    }
    const action = {
      type: 'UNKNOWN_ACTION',
      text: 'Learn Redux'
    }

    const expectedState = {
      todos: [ 'Learn Yarn' ]
    }

    const newState = reducer(initialState, action)

    expect(newState).toEqual(expectedState)
  })
})

```

As mentioned earlier:
 1. reducer's signature is `(state = <default>, action) => state`
 2. by convention `reducer` is actually a single `switch` statement

In unit tests we specified that:
 1. the default state value in the reducer is `{ todos: [] }`
 2. the only `action.type` (i.e. `case`) reducer recognizes is `ADD_TODO`

Create a `src/index.js` file and implement such a reducer:

```javascript
// index.js
export const reducer = (state = { todos: [] }, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_TODO':
      return {
        todos: [
          ...state.todos,
          action.text
        ]
      }
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

Gratification time üéâ

```bash
[js-stack-tutorail]$ yarn test
yarn test v0.24.6
$ standard --verbose | snazzy && jest --coverage

And voila! Reducer works fine. üéÇ

But wait, it's just a pure function with a few conventions around its shape.
Where's `redux`?

It's here, in your REPL! (I've added numbering in pseudo-comments to refer to 
certain lines in the description below the listing)

```bash
[js-stack-tutorail]$ ./node_modules/.bin/babel-node
# [1]
> const reducer = require('./src/index').reducer
> const redux = require('redux')
# [2]
> const store = redux.createStore(reducer)
> store
{ dispatch: [Function: dispatch],
  subscribe: [Function: subscribe],
  getState: [Function: getState],
  replaceReducer: [Function: replaceReducer] }
# [3]
> store.getState()
{ todos: [] }
# [4]
> store.dispatch({ type: 'ADD_TODO', text: 'Learn action creators' })
> store.getState()
{ todos: [ 'Learn action creators' ] }
> store.dispatch({ type: 'ADD_TODO', text: 'Learn async middleware' })
> store.getState()
{ todos: [ 'Learn action creators', 'Learn async middleware' ] }
# [5]
> store.dispatch({ type: 'ADD_POWER_POINT', text: 'Leverage agile frameworks to provide a robust synopsis for high level overviews.' })
> store.getState()
{ todos: [ 'Learn action creators', 'Learn async middleware' ] }
```

Let's go through it step by step:
 
 1. We import both our `reducer` and `redux`.     
    (Even `babel-node` doesn't let us use `import` statements, though it still 
    let us use `export` statement in our `src/index` module.)
 2. We create a new `store` providing it our `reducer`. It gets a slim `redux`
    interface of 4 methods (`dispatch`, `subscribe', `getState` and `replaceReducer`)
 3. The store has been initialized with the default state value in our `reducer`. üçæ
 4. Next we dispatch two 'ADD_TODO' actions and it turns out that each time the 
    state is updated according to our expectations. 
 5. Finally we dispatch an action our `reducer` doesn't understand, so it just
    passes without bothering the state. (good news: `redux` doesn't understand *corpo ipsum*!)
