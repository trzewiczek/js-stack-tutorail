# JS Stack Tutorail

These are my personal notes meant to help me dive deeper into JS environment 
setup based on React/Redux/RxJS. 

## Table of Contents
The steps of the process are:

 0. [Babel, Standard, ESDoc - basic environment setup](00.Environment/README.md)
 1. [Jest - first test first](01.Jest/README.md)
 2. [Redux - minimal console app](02.Redux/README.md)
 3. RxJS - console app with async
 4. Enzyme - testing GUI app
 5. React - GUI app
 6. Webpack, Gulp - packaging for the web
 7. Reselect - data transformations for UI


## Structure
Each section consists of four subsections:
 * 🛠 Basic setup
 * 🚀 In action
 * 📖 Resources 
 * 🔍 Extras

Additionally some sections contain additional subsection:
 * 🎓 Some theory

Inline *margin notes* are marked with 📝 emoji.

## Issues
I put this tutorial on github to let everyone submit issues and pull requests. 

## Disclaimer
It's all a basic non-production ready setup. It just an overview to help get
into the React/Redux/RxJS stack. For full blown JS stack setup (based on React 
as well) go to [JS Stack from Scratch](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch)

## Typo in the name
There is a typo in the name. It should be JS Stack Tutor**i**a~~i~~l. I know. 🤷‍♂️
