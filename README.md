JS Stack Tutorial
=================

These are my personal notes taken meanwhile I learnt how to 
set up JS environment. The steps of the process are:

 1. [Jest - initial test environment setup](01.Jest/README.md)
 2. Redux - minimal console app
 3. RxJS - console app with async
 4. Enzyme - testing GUI app
 5. React - GUI app
 6. Reselect - data transformations for UI

It's all a basic non-production ready setup. It just helps me
to clarify new material.
