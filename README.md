# JS Stack Tutorail

These are my personal notes meant to help me dive deeper into JS environment 
setup based on React/Redux/RxJS. 

## Table of Contents

The steps of the process are:

 1. [Jest - initial test environment setup](01.Jest/README.md)
 2. Redux - minimal console app
 3. RxJS - console app with async
 4. Enzyme - testing GUI app
 5. React - GUI app
 6. Reselect - data transformations for UI


## Disclaimer

It's all a basic non-production ready setup. It just an overview to help get
into the React/Redux/RxJS stack. For full blown JS stack setup (based on React 
as well) go to [JS Stack from Scratch](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch)
