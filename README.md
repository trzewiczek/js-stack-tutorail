JS Stack Tutorial
=================

These are my personal notes taken meanwhile I learnt how to 
set up JS environment. The steps of the process are:

 * [01. Jest - initial test environment setup](01.Jest/README.md)
 * 02. Redux - minimal console app
 * 03. RxJS - console app with async
 * 04. Enzyme - testing GUI app
 * 04. React - GUI app

It's all a basic non-production ready setup. It just helps me
to clarify new material.
