# JS Stack Tutorail

This is a tutorial on how to build a JavaScript application with Redux, RxJS, React 
and Reselect with a great support of Jest and Enzyme as well as Yarn, Standard, ESDoc, 
Webpack and Gulp. 

## Table of Contents

 0. [Babel, Standard, ESDoc](00.Environment/README.md)     
    In this chapter we'll build a rudimentary modern JavaScript development environment. 
    We'll only write as much as 8 lines of JavaScript but take our chances to proudly introduce some undignified callback function and to make it save and elegant after
    immediate intervention of `standard.js`.
 1. [Jest](01.Jest/README.md)      
    In this chapter we'll introduce one of the youngest pranksters on the block - `Jest`!
    With it's help we'll prepare ourselves to test-first journey. We will expect given
    promise to successfully resolve and so we're `DONE`.
 2. [Redux](02.Redux/README.md)      
    In chapter 2 not only we introduce `redux`, not only we'll use `Babel REPL`, but 
    finally we'll start building our tutorial application: **a travel planner**. 
    It won't do much, but we're do our best to implement it with grace and elegance!
 3. RxJS     
    Introducing `redux-observable` middleware we'll open our application to the world
    out there reaching as far as Yahoo Weather API. From now on our **travel planner**
    will no longer be a dummy parrot repeating what we've just said. 
 4. React, Enzyme    
    We'll leave our weather aware **travel planner** for one chapter to meet React and 
    Enzyme. This duo will help us safely and precisely move into a whole new dimension
    of Graphical User Interface. 
 5. React-Redux      
    In this chapter our **travel planner** will finally shine in the glory of the modern
    web technologies bringing user experience into new realm of the web browser. 
 6. Webpack, Gulp
    This chapter won't change much in our end user experience although it will let us
    deliver new features fast and efficient bringing us closer and closer to the highest
    industry standards of continuous deployment. 
 7. Reselect     
    With a seamless delivery process our **travel planner** grows fast with new features
    introduced every day. And with them the `store` grows fast coming closer and closer
    to the performance issues. In this chapter we'll introduce a wonderful library 
    utilizing `memoization`, an ancient technique of function caching.


## Structure
It's not consistent, but most of the time one can face four to five sections:
 * üéì Some theory in which we introduce some conceptual background
 * üõ† Basic setup in which we do configuration of tools and libraries
 * üöÄ In action in which we implement actual examples in JavaScript
 * üìñ Resources in which we provide basic links
 * üîç Extras in which we show some more in-depth topics out certain technology

One can run into üìù emoji which marks *margin notes* and some other random 
emojis here and there that bring no special value to the tutorail.

## Issues
I put this tutorail on github for reason. Don't complain‚Äîsubmit an issue or pull request.
